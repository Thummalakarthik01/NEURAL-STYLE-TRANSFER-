# Neural Style Transfer

This project implements Neural Style Transfer using deep learning to blend the content of one image with the artistic style of another. The result is a stylized image that retains the original structure while adopting the aesthetic of the chosen artwork.

## Features

- Transfer artistic style from one image to another
- Uses a pre-trained VGG19 model
- Easily customizable content and style images
- Supports GPU (if available)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - torch
  - torchvision
  - PIL
  - matplotlib

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow matplotlib

## How to Run Neural Style Transfer

1. *Install Python 3.x*  

2. *Install Required Libraries*  
   Open a terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) and run:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision pillow matplotlib
